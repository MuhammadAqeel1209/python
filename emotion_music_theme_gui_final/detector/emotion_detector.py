    Emotion Detection Using AI Concepts:

    1. Data Collection (Search Tree Nodes):
       - Capture multiple frames (nodes) from webcam representing different states.
    
    2. Preprocessing:
       - Resize frames for uniform input to the ML model.
    
    3. Feature Extraction & ML Prediction:
       - Use DeepFace's pretrained CNN model to extract features and classify emotions.
    
    4. Decision Making using MinMax-like Majority Voting:
       - Treat each frame's detected emotion as a leaf node value.
       - Aggregate using majority voting (like MinMax chooses best move from child nodes).
    
    5. Output:
       - Return the most confident (majority) emotion as the final decision.
